## Firmware

### How I made it

I took the starter code from the Hackpad guide and used a tutorial to make it use a matrix instead.
Then I used ChatGPT to learn how to program the display.

### What it does

The firmware makes the 4x4 Matrix into two parts. 
The top 3x4 is a numpad with 1-9 and the mulpitication and division function.
The bottom is a 4 key row where the 1st (leftmost) button types my whole email out,
the 2nd writes my school email out,
the 3nd writes my school password out,
and the 4th writes my home address which is very useful cause I always mess up on the 'Buellis' part
