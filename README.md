# Dhiaan's Button Overfilled Macropad

## The final product in Fusion 360

### My Schematic

I followed the Hackpad tutorial for the first version but after I figured out that 16 GPIO pins are too much I switched to a Matrix tutorial.
I followed the tutorial but instead of a 3x3 I made a 4x4.
The tutorial also explained how Anti-Ghosting worked so I also added diodes to incorperate the feature

### My PCB

For the PCB I did it on my own besides the OLED display fo which I took help from the Hackpad chat.

### The Case

The case was the part I thought was the hardest but ended up becoming really easy from the Hackpad tutorial.
The only thing I had trouble with was finding out where to place the OLED on the top panel beacuse since we added 20 mm to each dimension.

### The Firmware
